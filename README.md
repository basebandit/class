# Ardan Labs Ultimate Go Service Training
I attended the Ardan Labs Ultimate Go Service Remote Training on September. This is what I learned. Here is the source code that was used in the training. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to stretch his/her Go knowledge beyond the fundamentals and is looking for knowledge that will be of use in production environments.

# What I learned
- Mental Models (How to efficiently structure your Go web services).
- How to propagate request-scoped values in your web services. (Validating integrity of your requests,etc)
- How to use databases with the Golang sql driver (sqlx extension also used).
- How to model your data for efficient use and closely match your business needs. (Think data marshalling and unmarshalling).
- How to collect metrics from your web services using Go. (Observability purposes).
- Learnt how kubernetes comes in handy when deploying. (Kubernetes was used to deploy the production application images).
- Learnt how to test web services efficiently. (Both unit and integration tests)
- Learnt how to architect web services for the cloud.(Tied in with mental models)
